# open-tabs-as-md-links
Gets all the open Safari tabs links, and titles, and formats them into a Markdown list.

This AppleScript works best when installed as a service (Quick Action). When run it will take all of the open Safari tabs, grab the page title and their respective URLs, and create a Markdown unordered list with each tab and link. It puts the result on the system clipboard.
